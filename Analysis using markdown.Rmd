## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  
###Analysis on data.frame mtcars  
##using commands to know about the working of mtcars  
 **dim command** 
 **summary command**   
 **head command**  
 **tail command** 
 
```{r}
dim(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)

```
**to find relationship between cyl and hp command**  
```{r}
with(mtcars,plot(cyl,hp)) 
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
# Histogram with Normal Curve
x <- mtcars$mpg
h<-hist(x, breaks=10, col="red", xlab="Miles Per Gallon",
   main="Histogram Of MPG")
xfit<-seq(min(x),max(x),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue", lwd=2)
# Kernel Density Plot
d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
plot(d, xlab="MPG", main ="Density Of MPG")

```
**to find relationship between am and mpg command**  
```{r}  
  
with(mtcars,plot(am,mpg))
```
**to find relationship between cyl and gear command**  
```{r}  
plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)

```


```{r}

```
